# ReversePac-Man-TermProject
15-112 Term Project

This game is based off of the famous 1980 maze video game PacMan but with a twist! You as PacMan get to eat the ghosts!

Goal: Eat more chips than the ghosts before time is up! If the ghosts eat more than 60% of the chips at any point of time, you automatically lose. Whomp Whomp :(
How to Play:
1. Press S to start the game
2. Press P to pause the game
3. Press H for help
4. Press U to create your own board!
5. Press R at any point to restart the game!
7. Use your LRDU arrow keys to move your Pacman around to eat as many chips as possible!
8. You can slow ghosts down by eating them which causes them to respawn in the middle of the board again.
Note: Every board is randomly generated at the start of each game.

   Your score is listed at the bottom of the screen at all times. 

PowerUps:
You can freeze the ghosts for a few seconds by eating the Purple Star Powerup! Get the advantage over the ghost that are optimized to move and consume chips faster than the player by using the powerups!

Creating Your Own Board:
1. Press U to create your own board at any point of time!
2. You get to choose where to place each block:
   - Press T to start drawing
   - Press E to end drawing

Note: The Pacman must be able to travel to all chips on the board, hence closing off parts of the board is not allowed.
      If you try to select an invalid space (creates an invalid board) the game will let you know and will not allow you to select that space!
