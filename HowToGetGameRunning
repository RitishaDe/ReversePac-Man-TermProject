Instructions on how to run the game:

1. Download python (any version past 2 should be fine!)
2. Make sure you have an interpreter and have the path set correctly. 
3. Download all files in one folder (keep it organized so the program can find the gifs and etc easily)
4. Open up a terminal (Linux, VSCode, Windows etc) and navigate (cd) into the folder you are storing all of the files
5. Run BoardClass.py (main file) using a command such as py.exe -3 .\BoardClass.py
6. Enjoy!
